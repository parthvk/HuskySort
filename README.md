- Quicksort
- Do you agree that the number of swaps in “standard” quicksort is 1/6 times the number of comparisons? Is this figure correct? If not, why not. How do you explain it.

- Shell sort
- A. When shell-sorting a sorted array, the number of comparisons is logarithmic. Do you agree? What is the base of the logs? Explain your observations.
- B. Can you develop an expression for the average number of comparisons for shell-sort (choose any one of the “common” gap sequences). Recall that this is “unknown.”
- C. Can you develop an expression for the worst-case number of comparisons for the gap sequence you choose?
